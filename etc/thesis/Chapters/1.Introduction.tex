The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) has become ubiquitous in enterprise applications for its platform portability, performance, and stability.  Companies such as Google \cite{google-jvm}, Facebook \cite{facebook-hbase}, and Twitter \cite{java-at-twitter} all deploy the JVM at scale in their application stack.  The benefits of the JVM have enticed developers to build implementations of Python, Ruby, and over 100 domain specific languages that run on the JVM \cite{jvm-lang-summit}.  Languages like Jython and JRuby that target the JVM get access to generational garbage collection, native threading, and a highly optimized Just In Time (JIT) compiler.  

Regardless of the current level of adoption of other languages, the JVM was designed primarily to run Java.  All the concepts of Java -- classes, exceptions, strong typing, and the distinction between primitive and reference types -- are all represented in code targeting the JVM.  Therefore, language implementers are forced to express the concepts of their language in terms of JVM structures.  This becomes problematic when the language being implemented doesn't conform to JVM function invocation and typing semantics.  In order for languages using non-Java semantics to run on the JVM, significant workarounds must be used that increase implementation complexity, cause code bloat, and decrease runtime performance.

However, JVM 7 includes a new feature, \texttt{invokedynamic}, that makes the JVM a much more flexible and adaptable language host.  \texttt{invokedynamic} is a new bytecode instruction and runtime support library that allows a lower level of access into the class loading and linking operations of the JVM.  \texttt{invokedynamic} has the potential to improve language runtime performance significantly while at the same time reducing implementation complexity compared to current solutions.  Details of the current linking and invocation semantics of the JVM are described in Chapter \ref{chapter:JVM}.  \texttt{invokedynamic} itself is described in detail in Chapter \ref{chapter:Invokedynamic}, and its integration into a structural type system is described in Chapter \ref{chapter:StructuralTyping}.  Finally, a compiler for a language that supports structural typing for the JVM through the use of \texttt{invokedynamic} is described in Chapter \ref{chapter:Kale}.
