Kale Programming Language
=========================

Kale is the implementation of my undergraduate thesis, Structural Typing on the JVM with invokedynamic.

It uses the invokedynamic bytecode instruction and to build polymorphic inline caches with method handles that enable efficient invocation of structural types.
