========

- compiler needs to verify type equivalence

- generate __instanceof(Object) static method on every Kale class,
  that can be called as the fast path in an instanceof guard test,
  with the slow path being a InstanceOfCheck object that keeps
  a Class<?> instance field and does an Class.instanceOf(o) check
  as the slow path

- add golang-equivalent interface{} type as 'any'
  - dispatched as interface callsite
  
- function pointers
- function literals

- call into Java class/jar files
  - classpath descriptor file
  - read and parse class files to extract types
  - setup 'import' keyword, JavaTypeDecl AST/scope representation


Codegen
=======
- interface invocation invokedynamic site
- package imports

UI
==
- type feedback on hover/click
- type hierarchy tree per CompilationUnit
- multi-file inputs once package imports work (tabbed?)
